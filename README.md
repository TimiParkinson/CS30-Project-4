Iceman Game
This is a README file for the Iceman game. The game is a clone of SanMo's upcoming game called Iceman, and it has been developed by ElCo corporate spies to beat SanMo to the market. Please note that the actions taken by ElCo corporate spies to obtain the source files and prototype executable for this project are not appropriate in real life.

Game Description
In the Iceman game, the player controls a character called the Iceman, who needs to dig underground tunnels in an oil field to find oil. Each level in the game has a different oil field configuration, and the player must gather all available oil in a field to advance to the next level.

The game features various elements, including Boulders, Gold Nuggets, Water Pools, Sonar Kits, and Protesters. The Iceman can dig through the ice, pick up Barrels of oil, shoot Protesters with a squirt gun, drop Gold Nuggets to bribe Protesters, and cause Boulders to fall on Protesters.

There are two types of Protesters: Regular Protesters and Hardcore Protesters. Regular Protesters can be irritated by squirts or bribes and will leave the oil field. Hardcore Protesters are more dedicated and require more squirts to be irritated. They cannot be bribed and will continue to hunt the Iceman even after picking up Gold Nuggets.

The Iceman has a limited number of lives, and if the Iceman's health reaches zero due to being repeatedly shouted at by Protesters, a life is lost. The game continues until all lives are exhausted. Upon losing a life, the player can restart the level with full health, squirt gun water, and a sonar charge.

Game Mechanics
The game window is 64 squares wide by 64 squares high. Objects in the game, such as the Iceman, Protesters, Boulders, Gold Nuggets, and Sonar Kits, are 4 squares wide by 4 squares high. The Iceman can move within the oil field except on top of a Boulder. Protesters can only move in areas with no Ice or Boulders.

The game progresses through ticks, with multiple ticks per second. During each tick, the player can move the Iceman, shoot the squirt gun, use a sonar charge, or give up. Other game objects, excluding Ice, have opportunities to perform actions as well. New game objects may be added or existing objects may be removed during each tick.

Level Progression
As the game progresses, the levels become more challenging. The number of Barrels of oil to collect increases, the number of Protesters increases, and the availability of Water and Sonar Kits decreases. Protesters also move more quickly and are stunned for shorter durations when squirted or when they find a Gold Nugget.

Controls
The Iceman can be controlled using the arrow keys, WASD, or the numeric keypad. The spacebar is used to shoot the squirt gun. The Escape key can be used to sacrifice a life and restart the current level.

Please enjoy playing the Iceman game and remember that the actions portrayed in the game are not appropriate in real life.
